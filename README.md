SI unit of *magnetic flux* is weber $Wb$, with

$$Wb = V⋅s,$$

where $V$ is volt and $s$ is second.
The *magnetic flux* of $n⋅Wb$  through a surface of $n$ square meter $m^2$ is $n$ tesla $T$, or

$$T=\frac{Wb}{m^2}.$$

The geomagnetic field or *flux density* $B_E$ is calculated in microteslas $μT$ or gauss $G$, respectively, where 

$$G= μT⋅100.$$

$B_E$ normaly ranges from about $B_E>=0.25G$ to $B_E<=0.65G$.
